How will you test the changes?
To test changes in a Kubernetes environment, I will first apply all updates in a dedicated non-production cluster that closely mirrors the production setup. This test cluster will be used to deploy updated manifests, configuration changes, or new workloads. Automated integration and end-to-end tests will be executed using Kubernetes-native tools and scripts, such as kubectl, pytest, or Sonobuoy, to verify that pods are scheduled correctly, services are reachable, and application endpoints respond as expected. I will also use health checks and readiness/liveness probes to ensure that all components are running and ready. Additionally, I will perform manual smoke tests to validate basic cluster functionality, such as scaling deployments, rolling updates, and service discovery. Logs and events will be reviewed to identify any errors or warnings that may indicate issues with the changes.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
To ensure that changes do not negatively impact the cluster, I will implement a combination of regression testing, monitoring, and rollback procedures. Regression tests will confirm that existing features and workloads continue to operate as before after the changes are applied. Continuous monitoring and alerting, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana, will be in place to detect anomalies in resource usage, pod restarts, or failed deployments. I will also monitor application and system logs for unexpected behavior. If any issues are detected, I will use documented rollback procedures to revert to the previous stable state. Finally, all changes will undergo peer review and approval before being promoted to production, ensuring that multiple stakeholders validate the safety and effectiveness of the updates.
