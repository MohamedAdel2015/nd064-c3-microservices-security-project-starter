1. Incident commander name:  
Mohamed Adel Abdelfattah

2. Executive Summary of what happened:  
Three unauthorized pods associated with cryptocurrency mining were detected running within the cluster environment.

3. Summary of what was affected:  
The breach allowed the attacker to deploy and operate containers for crypto-mining purposes. Specifically, containers related to Monero mining (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) were executed, utilizing cluster resources for illicit mining activities.

4. Summary of the impact:  
The presence of crypto-mining workloads led to a substantial increase in CPU consumption across the cluster. 
Monitoring tools, such as the Kubernetes Compute Resources dashboard, indicated a noticeable spike in CPU usage correlating with the deployment of these unauthorized pods.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:  
To address the incident, the following command was used to forcibly remove the malicious pods:  
kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force  
After removal, resource utilization was monitored via Grafana and Falco dashboards to confirm that CPU usage returned to normal and no further mining activity was detected.

6. Summary of lessons learned:  
We should review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and the Grafana dashboards. 
Admission controllers can also be configured to disallow unknown images to be used to create containers. 
Additionally, we can update the priority of Falco rules for the metrics endpoint to the highest level.
